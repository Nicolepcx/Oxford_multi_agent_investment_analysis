        "This notebook implements a LangGraph workflow that generates LinkedIn posts using an LLM, with a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism. The flow includes three main components:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model Node**: Uses a language model (Llama 3 via Nebius) to generate a LinkedIn post based on a user-provided topic and optional feedback.\n",
        "- **Human Node**: Pauses execution to collect user feedback on the generated post. The user can iteratively refine the output or type `\"done\"` (or `\"exit\"`, `\"quit\"`, `\"q\"`) to finalize it.\n",
        "- **End Node**: Outputs the final post and feedback summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code uses LangGraph‚Äôs `interrupt()` and `and command()` mechanism to handle real-time input, and supports continuous, feedback-driven improvement of the generated content. The flow is structured using a `StateGraph`, and all interactions are managed with a `while True` loop that handles streaming and user input cleanly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** You can use either Open AI or any other LLM here, I used [Nebius](https://studio.nebius.com/), which offers fairly good prices on some common LLMs.\n",
